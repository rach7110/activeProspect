JQuery Event handling - .submit vs .click vs :submit
(form).click was  returning the success/error message whenever any part of the form was clicked. (form).submit fixed the experience so the message only shows when the submit button is clicked.
(':submit').click == (form).submit == ('#submit-button').click
